# Cancer Informatics for Research Leaders

Research is becoming evermore multidisciplinary. This requires more flexibility in our ability to communicate with team members who may have a distinct background from ourselves or from each other. Furthermore, team members often have different research and career goals. This can present unique challenges in making sure that everyone is on the same page and cohesively working together. This course aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about how to effectively interact with and guide team members on informatics projects.

## Collaborating with Informatics Experts

Studies investigating the nature of biology research labs over history indicate that collaboration has been on the rise since the 1950s^[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.03.001)^ and that the rate continues to increase^[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220040763_Scientific_collaboration)^. Indeed the size of biology research teams appear to have doubled from 1955 to 1990^[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.03.001)^. But why? 

### What are the benefits of collaboration?  

1) **Shared cost** - Now that research often involves expensive technology, it is cost effective to share resources.    
2) **Shared expertise** - Now that technology affords answering in some cases more complex research questions or in some cases broader research questions, it is often more effective to employ multiple contributors with different knowledge, skills, and perspectives.  Researchers have noted that their own concept of their field changed as a result of working with investigators from other disciplines. Thus this can lead to innovation ^[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6)^. 
3) **Shared burden** - Doing part of the work for a project using the knowledge and skills that you are most comfortable with and seeking help from others who are more knowledgeable on other research aspects can be a more efficient strategy. 
4) **Shared reliability** - Including multiple team members who can each evaluate the research can improve the reliability of a project, as mistakes can be found by other members.
5) **Shared credibility** - Collaborations involving experts of multiple areas can imporve the percieved credibility of the work by others.

### Potential Challenges:

1) **Challenging communication** - Extra care needs to be taken to ensure that communication across groups is effective.  
Typically researchers will not meet as often with a collaborator as they would with an internal team member. Therefore, poor communication in a collaboration can lead to more costly misdirection and thus wasted time and effort.

Furthermore, as investigators often have different backgrounds, differences in jargon and language can make communication more challenging. 

Having internal team members with some familiarity with informatics can be very beneficial for translating discussions with collaborators who are informatics experts. One solution to this is to have students, post docs, and other trainees work in both labs. This can be especially beneficial time for the trainee who will become accustomed to two research styles allowing them to potentially have their own multi-disciplinary lab in the future^[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6)^. 

Another important method that can help resolve this issue is to have members provide educational seminars for participating members about the fundamentals of their work.

2) **Differing research style and goals** -  Beyond differences in language, differences in research style and goals can lead to conflict.

"Scholars’ different styles of thought, standards, research traditions, techniques, and languages can be difficult to translate across disciplinary domains." ^[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6)^

Making clear research standards and goals, as well as outlining clear specific tasks at the beginning of a project can help to avoid this issue. Furthermore, meeting consistently throughout the duration of a project can also help to make sure that standards are in agreement.  Additionally these meetings should include discussions about intellectual property, authorship, leadership, and defining what sucess looks likes to the various members. Defining these details early can avoid major conflict later. 

Furthermore, it is critical to keep in mind the diversity of career goals of research team members, as junior team members may have a challenging time persuading others of their independence and contributions when they work on largely collaborative projects.  It is also necessary to ensure that junior members have time to devote to their own research programs. ^[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220040763_Scientific_collaboration)^ Support should be provided for these junior collaborators by more senior collaborators.


3) **Different contributions** - Research of multi-disciplinary collaborations have found that when collaborating members were unclear of how their expertise and work contributed to the projected, they were less motivated and felt less valued. Working with members of different backgrounds to determine how their expertise can contribute to the project will not only help with moral, but it can also better define how a collaborator can further contribute to a project in ways that you may not already expect!^[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6)^

4) **Reduced sense of responsibility** - Another concern of collaboration is that team members may feel less responsibility or commitment to a project than for a project within their own lab.

Defining tasks and expected due dates can help reduce this issue. Discussions to establish due dates should always include team members with expertise in each area of science, as tasks may not take the amount of time that another researcher would expect. It is a **common misconception** that informatics tasks take less time than the the tasks actually take in reality. 

5) **Research is dynamic** - Research always has an element of trial and error. Protocols may change and new scientific questions may emerge. Frequent meetings with all group members to understand the dynamics of the project are critical. Furthermore, flexibility and understanding is required. It should be expected that aspects about the project will change.

6) **Differences in resources** - Particularly when collaborating with community members, community colleges, and  institutions that are "Equity-oriented" serving populations that have historically been referred to as "minorities" ^[4](https://diverseeducation.com/article/91247/), it is important to keep in mind that large differences in resources may exist between collaborating members. 

Sharing and discussing budget information early and often can help research members to understand what expectations are reasonable and how collaboration partners may best assist one another.


### There are multiple ways to approach collaboration. 

AVOCADO - this section needs to be more tailored.

Four types have been defined by a study of scientific collaboration ^[5](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00145-7)^:

1) **Bureaucratic** - Collaborations of this style have a high level of formality, hierarchy, guidelines, and rules with clear specialized divisions of labor and responsibilities. This is particularly a useful strategy if any collaboration members have been historically competitive with one another or there is a large amount of money involved. Legal contracts and external evaluations are common.
2) **Leaderless** - There is administrative leadership but no scientific leadership. This allows for more flexibility scientifically. 
3) **Non-specialized** - There is no specialized division of labor despite hierarchical leadership. This method is especially useful for assessing reproducibility of a finding or for evaluating the reliability of a method. Teams are given the same tasks to work on. 
4) **Participatory** - This style is the least formal, yet still maintains aspects of leadership and division of labor. Researchers contribute equally to decisions about the project, there is no designated scientific leader. No legal or formal agreements are used, rather informal understandings are used as the foundation for guiding the project. 

Of note, the term Participatory action in contrast, involves collaborating with community members.

>Participatory action research values the knowledge,experiences, and norms of community members and seeks to incorporate
these into research projects. Its goal is to create new knowledge thatleads to effective social action that solves real-life problems.^[2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220040763_Scientific_collaboration)^

## Employing informatics experts

In contrast to collaborating with informatics experts, in some case it may be beneficial to directly employ them on your team. There are again pros and and cons for this strategy.

By directly employing an informatics expert, rather than collaborating with an expert, research leaders will have more access to meet with these experts, as well as more sway in terms of guiding the direction of the experts' work. They can also potentially grow the informatics part of their research program more readily which would then lead to even more flexibility in the research questions that they may be able to assess.

However, direct employment of informatics experts requires all of the typical responsibilities and costs of employing another lab member. It also requires the additional resource requirements for the informatics work of the particular expert. This will be discussed more in a later section of this course.  

In addition is is useful to become familiar with best practices for ethics, reliability, and reproducibility in computational work. This requires some different tactics than that of experiment based research (often called "wet lab" research). Although it is also useful for informatics expert to keep track of the work that they have performed in general, similar to maintaining notes about experimental research with a lab notebook, a much deeper level of detail can be tracked and maintained. What we mean by this, is that the actual code and data used in their work can be saved over time. This can be invaluable for research reproducbility. Thus research leaders are advised to become familiar with best practices for data sharing and data management so that they can most effectively manage their informatics employees. This is also discussed in more detail later in the course. 

## Mentoring informatics students

Mentorship is a particularly unique relational experience. While traditional mentorship has been defined by the heiarchical structure of a single mentor who teaches subordinate mentees, new styles have emerged that are not as constrained or limited as the traditional paradigm. At it's optimum, mentors and mentees should learn from each other and together and expand what each can do alone. importantly the more traditional pardigm that does not value "reciprical learning" as highly, has been shown to be less effective for a larger diversity of students.^[1](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176)^

For research groups that are newer to informatics, some of these less traditional paradigms may be especially useful, we will focus on a few here. 

![Alternative Montorship](images/mentoring_pardigms.png)

### Comentoring/Collaborative/team mentoring

As we described earlier, comentoring or collaborative mentoring of students by multiple mentors with different backgrounds can be particularly beneficial to the student and also to the lab.  In the case of collaborative mentoring where a mentee is mentored by two research experts in two  different labs, this provides an opportunity not only to particularly strengthen a collaboration, but also for students to gain more diverse knowledge, and to in turn provide more of the expertise that they gain back to both labs. Comentoring could also occur within the same lab by a research leader and an informatics expert within the lab. This could also work well in a multilevel paradigm, where an informatics expert may guide informatics related aspects of research, while an overarching research adviser may guide the student's overall research mentorship experience.

### Peer mentoring

Peer mentoring also provides great opportunities to expand students' expertise and skills without as much time constraints for the research leaders of a lab, particularly for skills that may be new to lab leadership. Furthermore, such paradigms are helpful for improving students' teaching skills, collaboration skills, self-reliance, and self-confidence. Teaching a peer, is often useful for students to identify gaps in their own knowledge, assisting in their own quest to "learn how to learn"^[1](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176)^. Furthermore, such paradigms appear to be especially beneficial to students of undeserved populations.^[1](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176)^ However, there are challenges for research leaders from a management standpoint. Mentors should be mindful of any conflicts that may arise between students. These can often be avoided with clear and distinct goals and projects for students, to avoid making students feel like they are competing with one another. Additionally, we highly recommend establishing a [code of conduct](https://i-sight.com/resources/18-of-the-best-code-of-conduct-examples/) for the lab, so that students and staff members are clear about what behavior is expected.

### Electronic mentoring 

With the COVID-19 Pandemic, the transition to using electronic means of contact with students and staff for research has expanded on an unprecedented scale. It is unclear currently how much this will continue in the future. However, research prior to the pandemic has shown some surprising benefits of providing mentorship through electronic means. Importantly it appears that this eases burdens for students who are balancing course work, as it often provides more scheduling flexibility. Additionally, such mentorship is particularly helpful for historically marginalized populations who may face more hostility by going to research institutes with face-to-face interaction with others. Even as we may return to more  on-site research labs, additional availability by mentors with mentees using electronic means of contact are likely to be beneficial. Technology such as [slack](https://slack.com/) can be especially useful for allowing lab members to interact with one another. 


### Career goals 

The job landscape for scientists has changed in recent decades with more opportunities outside academia in industry and government. Furthermore career goals for informatics students can be very different than that of other research students. By having informatics expertise, these students have **additional career opportunities**. 

Becoming aware of these opportunities yourself, as a research leader, is therefore critical to cultivating your mentees' awareness of the diversity of opportunities available to them. 

This will ultimately allow your mentees to choose the career path that suites them best. 

Possible career paths:

1) Academia - Your informatics mentees may have career opportunities as principal investigators, scientists, or educators just like other cancer biology mentees. In addition to opportunities as educators for informatics and biology, they will also have opportunities for data science.

2) Government - Your informatics mentees will may have career opportunities as scientist or policy maker for research institutes just like other cancer biology mentees. However, additional agencies and institutes may have a need for their data science skills on topics outside of biology. For example your mentee may have the skills to work for city police department.

3) Industry - Beyond the potential career options in the pharmaceutical industry, biotech, and medicine, your informatics mentees will have data science skills that may qualify them for jobs in a variety of industries. For example
your informatics mentees could find jobs at companies such as [Stich Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/) or [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com/) which use machine learning and or bioinformatics for their products, or your mentee may join a software company as a computer programmer or even as a programming educator at a company like [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). 

4) Nonprofit - Beyond research and management positions at nonprofits performing scientific or clinical research, informatics mentees may have opportunities at other nonprofits with other types of goals. For example, your mentee might find work at a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights and investigates social interactions in social media platforms.

According to [Brandon Rohrer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brohrer/),a data scientists who formally worked at [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) and now works at [iRobot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRobot), there are 4 major categories of knowledge and skills for data science:

1) **Data Analysis** - domain knowledge, research skills, and interpretation skills
2) **Data Modeling** - machine learning application skills, algorithm development skills
3) **Data Engineering** - data management skills, skills to make code production-level ready (ex. automation), software engineering
4) **Data Mechanics** - data formatting and cleaning, data handling (filtering, subsetting)



_Archetypes of data scientists:_

1) Beginner data scientists - exposure in each of the 4 areas - ideally how your mentee will be after training at a minimum if they hope to pursue a data science career!
2) Generalist - proficient in all areas - data science manager or executive - good for mentees who wish to stay in research!
3) Specialists
  a) Detective - strong in data analysis and mechanics and exposure in all 4 areas
  b) Oracle - strong in modeling and mechanics (great for machine learning companies)
  c) Maker - strong in mechanics and engineering

Intro to informatics/data science roles.

### Mentoring underrepresented students

Analyses of scientific article authorship indicate that women are underrepresented in computational biology.  This may be in part due to gender bias by research leadership in hiring female students ^[2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005134)^. Furthermore, women are more likely to be authors on papers where the last author is also female. Therefore, having fewer research leaders in computational biology may be responsible for fewer female computational biology mentees if females students are either more likely to be recruited or are more likely themselves to consider positions with a female role model as the research leader ^[2](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005134)^. Indeed training about bias awareness has been shown  (hmmm somehting about stelter et al paper...about cultural training etc... very good paper)

Indeed, research of females and other underrepresented groups in STEM including students with disabilities and of certain racial and ethnic groups suggests that role models of underrepresented populations are particularly important for recruiting and keeping students interested in fields where they may feel like an outsider ^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470)^. One strategy to encourage students of underrepresented populations is to provide students with exposure to such role models through regular seminars where scientists who represent these populations are prominent^[4](https://doi.org/10.1641/B570705)^. 

Overall suggestions:

AVocado - I need to know about resources that might be more tailored to stem mentorships.... 

1) Seek **training about disparities** in informatics and STEM career achievement and attitudes, biases, and stereotypes that are hindrances.

Note that you may not be aware of the barriers of achievement that your mentees may face. For example, mentees from low socioeconomic backgrounds, mentees with disabilities, mentees who have immigrated, older mentees, mentees of traditionally underrepresented races and ethnic groups, and mentees with gender identities that are underrepresented face unique and overlapping challenges. It is also important to learn about how **intersectionality** (the idea that  some individuals may represent more than one underrepresented group (ex. female and black)) results in more nuanced challenges. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDtnfQ9FHc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


Become aware of **stereotype threat** - "an internal feeling and concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, and age) with which the individual identifies"^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470)^ and how they miss influence your mentees.

Also, become aware of as  **microgaressions** - "subtle verbal and nonverbal slights, insults, or invalidations directed at individuals due to their membership in a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and physical disability), which are rooted in biases about individuals in that group"^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470)^.

See [here](https://www.messiah.edu/download/downloads/id/921/Microaggressions_in_the_Classroom.pdf) for a list of examples.


Importantly, "mentors for students with disabilities should receive training, as needed, on their mentee’s specific disability and should be made aware of the accommodations that students may need to succeed in activities and courses" ^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470)^. 

2) **Appreciate and acknowledge mentee's differences**. Research shows that mentees of underrepresented racial groups would prefer their mentors to directly discuss their background differences and how to best cultivate their career success. An attitude of ["color-blindness"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010) about race has shown to hinder the success of mentees ^[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000106), [6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010)^. 

**However, singling out individuals for their differences is often felt as a microaggression.**  There are ways to discuss these topics with your student without singling them out in front of the rest of a group.

> "Racial/ethnic differences between mentees and mentors in interracial mentoring relationships can pose cultural barriers to effective mentoring of HU (Historically underrepresented) students and even affect students’ professional and psychosocial success, especially when complex racial/ethnic issues are not effectively handled or addressed..." ^[5](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000106)^

>Two ideological perspectives – **colorblindness and multiculturalism** – have emerged to shed light on this question. Colorblindness downplays the salience and importance of race by focusing on the commonalities people share, such as one's underlying humanity. In contrast, multiculturalism acknowledges and highlights racial differences^[6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010)^.

>"Exposure to colorblind (vs. multicultural) messages predicts negative outcomes among Whites such as greater implicit and explicit racial bias ([Richeson & Nussbaum, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100240X?via%3Dihub#bb0080))"^[6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010)^

> "Not only do minorities prefer multiculturalism ([Ryan et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100240X?via%3Dihub#bb0085), [Verkuyten, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100240X?via%3Dihub#bb0105)), they benefit when others around them endorse multiculturalism ([Plaut et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100240X?via%3Dihub#bb0070))"^[6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010)^

3) **Work to create a safe environment**. Educate lab mentors about cultural sensitivity and micrograrresions. Highlight the importance of collaboration and create a [code of conduct](https://i-sight.com/resources/18-of-the-best-code-of-conduct-examples/) for the lab.

4) **Role models** make career goals seem possible. Expose all mentees to a diverse range of role models through seminars, journal clubs, and participation in conferences.

5) **Advocate for all mentees**, particularly those from underrepresented groups by introducing your mentee to other scientists and trainees, encouraging the participation of your mentees in support programs and groups such as graduate student groups and helping mentees cultivate self advocacy practices through open discussions and encouragement.

6) Support a **healthy relationship with failure** by being a good role model and openly discussing the role of failure in research. For example, you may describe failures in your own career or you may read some of the book Brilliant Blunders by Mario Livio with your mentees. This book describes how scientific advancement actually occurred due to mistakes of some of the most respected scientists. Educating mentees about the **[Growth Mindset](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)** described by Carol Dweck may also be helpful. The major themes of this mindset is an awareness that our abilities are not fixed, we can change our aptitudes with practice and work.

![Growth Mindset](images/growthmindset.jpg)

[[source]](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)


7) **Celebration and microaffrimations** Be sure to celebrate all of your mentee's small and large successes. This has been shown to promote self-confidence and positivity ^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470),[7](https://doi.org/10.1038/447791a)^.

8) **Give feedback with cultural sensitivity** - It is important to be aware that your mentee may be struggling with feeling like they belong when you provide feedback^[3](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470), [7]^(https://doi.org/10.1038/447791a).

9) In addition to creating a [code of conduct](https://i-sight.com/resources/18-of-the-best-code-of-conduct-examples/) for the lab, consider creating a document that outlines **mentor and mentee expectations**. See [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005709.s001) for an example of such document ^[8](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005709)^ and see [here](https://ictr.wisc.edu/mentoring/) for more information. Keep in mind that such forms should be tailored for different career stages of your mentees and for mentees who are pursuing different expertise. Informatics mentees should incorperate guidelines about data management practices.
