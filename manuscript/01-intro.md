# Introduction 

## Motivation
This course will cover the key cancer informatics topics principal investigators (PI) and other research leaders need to know when running a lab. 

**Target Audience:**  
The course is intended for PIs and other lab leaders who want to learn how to transition their labs to using cancer informatics tools, for those who rely on cancer informatics but for whom it is not a core competency, as well as, PIs for whom informatics is a key part of their research. 

**Curriculum:**  
This course will feature a range of ITCR tools from the very general (Galaxy7, Bioconductor56) to those that are very application specific (CRAVAT10, CIVIC13) but tools will only be featured at a conceptual level, rather than through hands on engagement in workflows. For more in-depth information about particular tools, see our other courses at our website: www.itcrtraining.org. 

The curriculum will also cover the roles and responsibilities of a lab leader in collaborative, mentor, or employer relationships with informatics experts. It will cover budgeting for cancer informatics locally or on the cloud, as well as key responsibilities for research leaders in data security, privacy, management and reproducibility.
