# Cancer Informatics for Research Leaders

Research is becoming evermore multidisciplinary. This requires more flexibility in our ability to communicate with team members who may have a distinct background from ourselves or from each other. Furthermore, team members often have different research goals and career goals. This can present unique challenges in making sure that everyone is on the same page and aware of the status of current projects and that team members are cohesively working together. This course aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about how to effectively interact with and guide team members on informatics projects.

## Collaborating with Informatics Experts

Studies investigating the nature of biology research labs over history indicate that collaboration has been on the rise since the 1950s and that the rate of collaboration continues to increase. Indeed the size of our research teams in biology appear to have doubled from 1955 to 1990^[1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.03.001)^. But why? What are the benefits of collaboration?

1) **Shared cost** - Now that research often involves expensive technology, it is cost effective to share resources.    
2) **Shared expertise and credibility** - Now that technology affords answering in some cases more complex research questions or in some cases broader research questions, it is often more effective to employ multiple contributors with different knowledge, skills, and perspectives.  
3) **Shared burden** - Doing part of the work for a project using the knowledge and skills that you are most comfortable with and seeking help from others who are more knowledgeable on other research aspects can be a more efficient strategy for getting more work done in a timely manner.  

There are multiple ways to approach collaboration. 

1) **Egalitarian approach** - Researchers contribute equally to decisions about the project.  
2) **Hierarchical approach** - A single researcher or a select few guide the project.

Potential Downsides:

1) **Challenging communication** - Extra care needs to be taken to ensure that communication across groups is effective.  
Typically researchers will not meet as often with a collaborator as they would with an internal team member. Therefore,   poor communication  in a collaboration can lead to more costly misdirection and wasted time and effort.

2) **Conflicting goals** -  

## Employing informatics experts

In contrast to collaborating with an informatics expert, in some case it may be more beneficial to directly employ one.
