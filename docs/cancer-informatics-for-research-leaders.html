<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Cancer Informatics for Research Leaders</h1>
<p>Research is becoming more and more multidisciplinary. This requires more flexibility in our ability to communicate with team members who may have a distinct background from ourselves. Furthermore, team members often have different research and career goals. This can present unique challenges in making sure that everyone is on the same page and cohesively working together. This course aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about how to effectively interact with and guide team members on informatics projects.</p>
<div id="collaborating-with-informatics-experts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Collaborating with Informatics Experts</h2>
<p>Studies investigating biology research labs over history indicate that collaboration has been on the rise since the 1950s<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.03.001">1</a></sup> and that the rate continues to increase<sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220040763_Scientific_collaboration">2</a></sup>. Indeed the size of biology research teams appear to have doubled from 1955 to 1990<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endeavour.2013.03.001">1</a></sup>. But why?</p>
<div id="the-benefits-of-collaboration" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> The benefits of collaboration</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Shared cost</strong> - Research often involves expensive technology, thus it is cost effective to share resources.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Shared expertise</strong> - Now that technology affords answering in some cases more complex or broader research questions, it is often more effective to employ multiple contributors with different knowledge, skills, and perspectives. Researchers have noted that their own concept of their field changed as a result of working with investigators from other disciplines. Thus this can lead to innovation <sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>Shared burden</strong> - Doing part of the work for a project using the knowledge and skills that you are most comfortable with and seeking help from others who are more knowledgeable on other research aspects can be a more efficient strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Shared reliability</strong> - Including multiple team members who can each evaluate the research can improve the reliability of a project, as mistakes can be found by other members.</li>
<li><strong>Shared credibility</strong> - Collaborations involving experts of multiple areas can improve the perceived credibility of the work by others.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/collaboration.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="potential-challenges" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Potential Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always challenges when collabrating with others, but some of these are particularly enhanced in multi-disciplinary teams. Here are some challenges that you may encounter when a collaboration involves informatics experts.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Communication Differences</strong> - Extra care needs to be taken to ensure that communication across groups is effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically researchers will not meet as often with a collaborator as they would with an internal team member. Therefore, poor communication in a collaboration can lead to more costly misdirection and thus wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as investigators often have different backgrounds, differences in jargon and language can make communication more challenging.</p>
<p>Having <strong>internal</strong> team members with some <strong>familiarity</strong> with informatics can be very beneficial for translating discussions with collaborators who are informatics experts.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to have <strong>trainees work in both labs</strong>. This can be especially beneficial for the trainee who will become accustomed to two research styles and will learn a diverse set of skills, allowing them to potentially have their own multi-disciplinary lab in the future<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Another important method that can help resolve this issue is to have members provide <strong>educational seminars</strong> for participating members about the fundamentals of their work.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Different research style and goals</strong> - Beyond differences in language, differences in research style and goals can lead to conflict.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“Scholars’ different styles of thought, standards, research traditions, techniques, and languages can be difficult to translate across disciplinary domains.” <sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making clear research standards and goals, as well as outlining clear specific tasks at the beginning of a project can help to avoid this issue. Furthermore, meeting consistently throughout the duration of a project can also help to make sure that standards are maintained. Additionally, these meetings should include discussions about intellectual property, authorship, leadership, and defining what success looks likes to each of the various members. Defining these details early can avoid major conflict later.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is critical to keep in mind the diversity of career goals of research team members, as junior team members may have a challenging time persuading others of their independence and contributions when they work on largely collaborative projects. It is also necessary to ensure that junior members have time to devote to their own research programs. <sup><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220040763_Scientific_collaboration">2</a></sup> Support should be provided for these junior collaborators by more senior collaborators.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Different capabilities</strong> - Research of multi-disciplinary collaborations has revealed that when collaborating members are unclear of how their expertise and work contributes to the project, they are less motivated and fell less valued.</li>
</ol>
<p>Working with members of different backgrounds to determine how their expertise can contribute to the project, as opposed to simply assigning them a task, will not only help with moral, but it can also better define how a collaborator can further contribute to a project in ways that you may not already expect<sup><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11024-019-09381-6">3</a></sup>.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Reduced sense of responsibility</strong> - Another concern of collaboration is that team members may feel less responsibility or commitment to a project than for a project within their own lab.</li>
</ol>
<p>Defining tasks and expected due dates can help reduce this issue. Discussions to establish due dates should <strong>always include</strong> team members with <strong>expertise in each area</strong> of science, as tasks may not take the amount of time that another researcher would expect. It is a common misconception that informatics tasks take less time than the tasks actually take in reality.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Research is dynamic</strong> - Research always has an element of trial and error. Protocols may change and new scientific questions may emerge. Frequent meetings with all group members to understand the dynamics of the project are critical. Furthermore, flexibility and understanding is required. It should be expected that aspects about the project will change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Different levels of resources</strong> - Particularly when collaborating with community members, community colleges, and institutions that are “Equity-oriented” serving populations that have historically been marginalized or “minoritized”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>(<a href="https://diverseeducation.com/article/91247/" class="uri">https://diverseeducation.com/article/91247/</a>), it is important to keep in mind that large differences in resources may exist between collaborating members.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sharing and discussing budget information early and often can help research members to understand what expectations are reasonable and how collaboration partners may best assist one another.</p>

<div id="employing-informatics-experts" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Employing informatics experts</h2>
<p>In contrast to collaborating with informatics experts, in some case it may be beneficial to directly employ them on your team. There are again pros and and cons for this strategy.</p>
<p>By directly employing an informatics expert, rather than collaborating with an expert, research leaders will have more access to meet with these experts more often. Research leaders may also have more sway in terms of guiding the direction of the experts’ work. Leaders can also potentially grow the informatics part of their research program more readily, leading to even more flexibility in the research questions that they may be able to assess.</p>
<p>However, direct employment of informatics experts requires all of the typical responsibilities and costs of employing another lab member. It also requires the additional resource requirements for the informatics work of the particular expert. This will be discussed more in a later section of this course.</p>
<p>In addition is is useful to become familiar with best practices for ethics, reliability, and reproducibility in computational work. This requires some different tactics than that of experiment based research (often called “wet lab” research). Although it is also useful for informatics experts to keep track of the work that they have performed in general, similar to maintaining notes about experimental research with a lab notebook, a much deeper level of detail can be tracked and maintained. What we mean by this, is that the actual code and data used in their work can be saved over time. This can be invaluable for research reproducbility. Thus research leaders are advised to become familiar with best practices for data sharing and data management so that they can most effectively manage their informatics employees. This is also discussed in more detail later in the course.</p>
</div>
<div id="mentoring-informatics-students" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Mentoring informatics students</h2>
<p>Mentorship is a particularly unique relational experience. While traditional mentorship has been defined by the hierarchical structure of a single mentor who teaches subordinate mentees, new styles have emerged that are not as constrained or limited as the traditional paradigm. At it’s optimum, mentors and mentees should learn from each other and together and expand what each can do alone. Importantly the more traditional paradigm that does not value “reciprocal learning” as highly, has been shown to be less effective for a larger diversity of students.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176">1</a></sup></p>
<p>For research groups that are newer to informatics, some of these less traditional paradigms may be especially useful, we will focus on a few here.</p>

<div id="co-mentoringcollaborativeteam-mentoring" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Co-mentoring/Collaborative/team mentoring</h3>
<p>As we described earlier, co-mentoring or collaborative mentoring of students by multiple mentors with different backgrounds can be particularly beneficial to the student and also to the partnering labs. In the case of collaborative mentoring where a mentee is mentored by two research experts in two different labs, this provides an opportunity not only to strengthen a collaboration, but also for students to gain more diverse knowledge, and to in turn provide more of the expertise that they gain back to both labs. Co-mentoring could also occur within the same lab by a research leader and an informatics expert. This could also work well in a multilevel paradigm, where an informatics expert may guide informatics related aspects of research, while an overarching research adviser may guide the student’s overall research mentorship experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-mentoring" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Peer mentoring</h3>
<p>Peer mentoring also provides great opportunities to expand students’ expertise and skills without as much time constraints for the research leaders of a lab, particularly for skills that may be new to lab leadership. Furthermore, such paradigms are helpful for improving students’ teaching skills, collaboration skills, self-reliance, and self-confidence. Teaching a peer is often useful for students to identify gaps in their own knowledge, and assisting in their quest to “learn how to learn”<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176">1</a></sup>. Furthermore, such paradigms appear to be especially beneficial to students of historically marginalized populations.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14176">1</a></sup> However, there are challenges for research leaders from a management standpoint. Mentors should be mindful of any conflicts that may arise between students. These can often be avoided with clear and distinct goals and projects for students, to avoid making students feel like they are competing with one another. Additionally, we highly recommend establishing a <a href="https://i-sight.com/resources/18-of-the-best-code-of-conduct-examples/">code of conduct</a> for the lab, so that students and staff members are clear about what behavior is expected.</p>
</div>
<div id="electronic-mentoring" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Electronic mentoring</h3>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, the transition to using electronic means of contact with students and staff for research has expanded on an unprecedented scale. It is unclear currently how much this will continue in the future. However, research prior to the pandemic has shown some surprising benefits of providing mentorship through electronic means. Importantly it appears that this eases burdens for students who are balancing course work, as it often provides more scheduling flexibility. Additionally, such mentorship is particularly helpful for historically marginalized populations who may face more hostility by going to research institutes with face-to-face interaction with others or may have additional scheduling conflicts. Even as we may return to more on-site research labs, additional availability by mentors with mentees using electronic means of contact are likely to be beneficial. Technology such as <a href="https://slack.com/">slack</a> can be especially useful for allowing lab members to interact with one another. We will cover more about this soon.</p>
</div>
<div id="career-goals" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Career goals</h3>
<p>The job landscape for scientists has changed in recent decades with more opportunities outside academia in industry and government. Furthermore career goals for informatics mentees can be very different than that of other research mentees. By having informatics expertise, these trainees have <strong>additional career opportunities</strong>.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of these opportunities yourself, as a research leader, is therefore critical for cultivating your mentees’ awareness of the diversity of opportunities available to them. This will ultimately allow your mentees to choose the career path that suites them best.</p>
<div id="career-paths-for-informatics-mentees" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4.1</span> Career Paths for Informatics Mentees</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Academia - Your informatics mentees may have career opportunities as principal investigators, scientists, or educators just like other cancer biology mentees. In addition to opportunities as educators for informatics and biology, they will also have opportunities for data science.</p></li>
<li><p>Government - Your informatics mentees will may have career opportunities as scientist or policy maker for research institutes just like other cancer biology mentees. However, additional agencies and institutes may have a need for their data science skills on topics outside of biology. For example your mentee may have the skills to work for city police department.</p></li>
<li><p>Industry - Beyond the potential career options in the pharmaceutical industry, biotech, and medicine, your informatics mentees will have data science skills that may qualify them for jobs in a variety of industries. For example
your informatics mentees could find jobs at companies such as <a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stich Fix</a> or <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/">Ancestry</a> which use methods in machine learning and bioinformatics for their products. Additionally, your mentee may also have opportunities to join a software company as a computer programmer or even as a programming educator at a company like <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Nonprofit - Beyond research and management positions at nonprofits performing scientific or clinical research, informatics mentees may have opportunities at other nonprofits with other types of goals. For example, your mentee might find work at a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights and investigates social interactions in social media platforms.</p></li>

<div id="informatics-project-expectations" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4.2</span> Informatics Project Expectations</h4>
<p>One common misconception is that informatics research projects work out more often or are faster than that of wet bench research projects. This is however not necessarily true and informatics projects are just as likely to fail and often take more time than one might expect. However, one advantage of an informatics project is that there is ample free data available to add to or shift or reframe a project if necessary. This is important to keep in mind when advising your mentees and guiding the planning of their projects.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why an informatics project might fail:<br />
1) the data is not of high enough quality or lacks consistency (this may be do to a faulty method, methodological differences between lab personnel, expired reagents, temperature differences on data collection days etc.)
2) there is not a strong enough signal in the data to detect with the current data/methods - ie. you need more data or methods with greater granularity
2) the method of data collection becomes obsolete (this may not make the project fail per se but can make publication difficult)
4) the signal does not exist</p>
<p>Ways to mitigate project failure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Diversify projects</strong><br />
It is a good idea to diversify your mentees’ projects to enable them to have exposure to different projects, as well as more opportunities to contribute to a project that will ultimately result in a product such as an academic paper or a new software package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safe project planning</strong><br />
Make sure each mentee has at least one very solid project. For example, assign a review article, a simple software package, or a project with very promising pilot data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Co-authorship</strong><br />
Allow mentees to work together on projects. Assign one mentee as the main personnel, but allow other mentees to contribute in small ways to allow them to at least get co-authorship, just in case their main projects fails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan for ample time</strong><br />
Plan for projects to have adequate time to account for drawbacks. For example, if possible plan on the possibility that additional data may need to be collected or perhaps more data will need to be added from a data resource. It will take additional time to analyze the new data. Unfortunately, simply plugging in new data to an existing script hardly ever works.
Instead the following tasks are required:</p></li>
<li><p>Check the quality of the new data<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Reformat/wrangle the new data to match that of the existing data<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate how different the new data is from the old data - are they similar enough to be included in a larger analysis or does this require two analyses?</p></li>
<li><p>Perform the analysis on the new data</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adjust and reframe</strong><br />
When a project appears to fail because the data turns out to not be adequate for answering your original question, reframe the project to answer a question that the data actually can answer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if the goal of a project was to look for differential gene expression of a single gene and no significant difference is found, consider evaluating the gene expression of a pathway or network of genes that are involved in the same biological process. It is best to be transparent about your scientific process in your publications.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Get new data</strong><br />
In the worst case that the data does not appear to work for your initial goal and reframing the question does not seem possible, look for new data. Now there are many data resources available online.</li>

<div id="authorship-considerations" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4.3</span> Authorship Considerations</h4>
<p>There are also additional types of papers that your informatics mentee can publish, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data resource papers, where your mentee may publish an article introducing a data resource</li>
<li>Software papers - an article where the functionality and development of piece of software is discussed</li>
</ol>
<p>When guiding your mentee through the publication process, it is a good idea to keep in mind their career goals as you priortize different paper ideas. For example a mentee that is interested in pursuing a data engineering career may benefit more from a Software paper than other mentees.</p>

<div id="mentoring-underrepresented-students" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.5</span> Mentoring underrepresented students</h3>
<p>The inclusion of diverse populations in scientific teams has been shown to improve innovation<sup>[2](<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915378117" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915378117</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scholars from underrepresented groups have origins, concerns, and experiences that differ from groups traditionally represented, and their inclusion in academe diversifies scholarly perspectives. In fact, historically underrepresented groups often draw relations between ideas and concepts that have been traditionally missed or ignored<sup>[2](<a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915378117" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915378117</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, analyses of scientific article authorship indicate that women are underrepresented in computational biology<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005134">3</a></sup> and biomedical engineering<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02222-3">4</a></sup> and analyses of university faculty and students demonstrate that both women and historically marginalized populations (such as Black, Hispanic, and Native American) remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in the US and in Europe<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915378117">2</a></sup>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008210">5</a>^.</p>
<p>In order to best support and encourage mentees of underrepresented groups in cancer informatics, we suggest the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Seek <strong>training about disparities</strong> in informatics and STEM career achievement and attitudes, biases, and stereotypes that are hindrances.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you may not be aware of the barriers of achievement that your mentees may face. For example, mentees from low socioeconomic backgrounds, mentees with disabilities, mentees who have immigrated, older mentees, mentees of traditionally underrepresented races and ethnic groups, and mentees with gender identities that are underrepresented face unique and overlapping challenges. It is also important to learn about how <strong>intersectionality</strong> (the idea that some individuals may represent more than one underrepresented group (ex. female and black)) results in more nuanced challenges.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ViDtnfQ9FHc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>Become aware of <strong>stereotype threat</strong> - “an internal feeling and concern about confirming a negative stereotype associated with a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, and age) with which the individual identifies”<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470">6</a></sup> and how they miss influence your mentees.</p>
<p>Also, become aware of as <strong>microgaressions</strong> - “subtle verbal and nonverbal slights, insults, or invalidations directed at individuals due to their membership in a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, sexual orientation, and physical disability), which are rooted in biases about individuals in that group”<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.messiah.edu/download/downloads/id/921/Microaggressions_in_the_Classroom.pdf">here</a> for a list of examples.</p>
<p>Importantly, “mentors for students with disabilities should receive training, as needed, on their mentee’s specific disability and should be made aware of the accommodations that students may need to succeed in activities and courses” <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470">6</a></sup>.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Appreciate and acknowledge mentee’s differences</strong>. Research shows that mentees of underrepresented racial groups would prefer their mentors to directly discuss their background differences and how to best cultivate the mentee’s career success given their background. An attitude of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010">“color-blindness”</a> about race has shown to hinder the success of mentees<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>(<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000106" class="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000106</a>), <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010">8</a>^.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>However, singling out individuals for their differences is often felt as a microaggression.</strong> There are ways to discuss these topics with your student in private without singling them out in front of the rest of a group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Racial/ethnic differences between mentees and mentors in interracial mentoring relationships can pose cultural barriers to effective mentoring of HU (Historically underrepresented) students and even affect students’ professional and psychosocial success, especially when complex racial/ethnic issues are not effectively handled or addressed…”<sup><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dhe0000106">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Two ideological perspectives – <strong>colorblindness and multiculturalism</strong> – have emerged to shed light on this question. Colorblindness downplays the salience and importance of race by focusing on the commonalities people share, such as one’s underlying humanity. In contrast, multiculturalism acknowledges and highlights racial differences<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010">8</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Exposure to colorblind (vs. multicultural) messages predicts negative outcomes among Whites such as greater implicit and explicit racial bias (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311100240X?via%3Dihub#bb0080">Richeson &amp; Nussbaum, 2004</a>)”<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.09.010">8</a></sup></p>

<li><p><strong>Work to create a safe environment</strong>. Educate lab mentors about cultural sensitivity and micrograrresions. Highlight the importance of collaboration and create a <a href="https://i-sight.com/resources/18-of-the-best-code-of-conduct-examples/">code of conduct</a> for the lab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Role models</strong> make career goals seem possible. Expose all mentees to a diverse range of role models through seminars, journal clubs, and participation in conferences.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Computational biology papers with female authors are more likely to have a last author is also female. It is unclear if this is because women are more likely to hire other women and or if females are more likely to choose a lab with a female advisor <sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005134">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, research of females and other underrepresented groups in STEM including students with disabilities and of certain racial and ethnic groups suggests that role models of underrepresented populations are particularly important for recruiting and keeping students interested in fields where they may feel like an outsider<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14470">6</a></sup>. One strategy to encourage students of underrepresented populations is to provide students with exposure to such role models through regular seminars where scientists who represent these populations are prominent<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1641/B570705">9</a></sup>.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Advocate for all mentees</strong>, particularly those from underrepresented groups by introducing your mentee to other scientists and trainees, encouraging the participation of your mentees in support programs and groups such as graduate student groups and helping mentees cultivate self advocacy practices through open discussions and encouragement.</p></li>
<li><p>Support a <strong>healthy relationship with failure</strong> by being a good role model and openly discussing the role of failure in research. For example, you may describe failures in your own career or you may read some of the book Brilliant Blunders by Mario Livio with your mentees. This book describes how scientific advancement actually occurred due to mistakes of some of the most respected scientists. Educating mentees about the <strong><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth Mindset</a></strong> described by Carol Dweck may also be helpful.

<p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> is a communication tool that allows you to communicate with lab members much more efficiently than email. It is a bit like a combination of an instant message system and email and dropbox.</p>

<p>You can do quite well with the free version of slack. It may be all that your research group needs indefinitely. The major difference between the free version and the paid versions is that the free version does not save all of your message history.</p>
<p>Currently, with the free version you can search through the history of the last 10,000 messages. From our experience using this with a department of about 250 people, it takes about a year to reach this. If there are any really important messages or files, make sure to save them just in case.</p>

These channels can include all members of the workspace or specific subsets of members. Team members can also have separate direct messages to have one-on-one discussions.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to check if your department or institute is already using slack. If so, they may have a workspace that you can join. Otherwise you may want to think about recruiting your department or institute to start using slack. In this case you could start a workspace where people outside your research group can communicate. This would still allow you to have group messages with your lab or specific groups within the lab. Otherwise, you can start a workspace just for your research group.</p>

<div id="channels" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2.2</span> Channels</h4>
<p>Channels are the main way in which you can converse with your team on slack.</p>
<p>We recommend making a slack channel for your entire research group. Everyone in your group will be able to discuss something by sending messages in real time. If someone is not available at that time, they will see the message when they next check slack.
We also recommend making project specific channels. For these channels you can add all of the team members working on a specific project, so that they can easily discuss and review discussions about the project.</p>
<p>Importantly, you can make channels private or public. If a channel is public, anyone in the workspace can join.</p>

<div id="pins" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3.1</span> Pins</h4>
<p>If someone sends a really important message, like a link to a relevant document, you can “pin” the message so that it is easier to find later.</p>
<p>Hovering over a message you will get the following options:</p>
<p><img src="images/slack_options.png" alt="slack message options" />
Clicking on the 3 dot button allows you to do several useful things for a message including pinning it to find it easily later.</p>

<div id="code" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3.2</span> Code</h4>
<p>One great feature about slack, is that it is very convenient to message about code.</p>
<p><img src="images/slack_code.png" alt="slack code" />
You can also attach files directly to messages just like in the above message which has a screen shot image file.</p>
</div>
<div id="reminders" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3.3</span> Reminders</h4>
<p>If you want to be reminded about a message in 20 minutes or next week you can also do that using the same hovering and 3 dot button option.</p>

<p>You may also notice in the image above that your messages can be <strong>edited!</strong> unlike an email.</p>
</div>
<div id="polls" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3.4</span> Polls</h4>
<p>One other nice feature for working with a team is that you can directly poll your team.</p>
