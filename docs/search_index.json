["about-this-course.html", "About this Course", " About this Course This course is part of a series of courses for the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) called the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research Education Resource. This material was created by the ITCR Training Network (ITN) which is a collaborative effort of researchers around the United States to support cancer informatics and data science training through resources, technology, and events. Our courses feature tools developed by ITCR Investigators and make it easier for principal invesitgators, scientists, and analysts to integrate cancer informatics into their workflows. Please see our website at www.itcrtraining.org for more information. "],
["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation 1.2 Informatics for Cancer Research", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 Motivation This course will cover the key cancer informatics topics principal investigators and other research leaders need to know when running a lab. Target Audiance: The course is intended for PIs and other lab leaders who want to learn how to transition their labs into using cancer informatics tools, for those who rely on cancer informatics but for whom it is not a core competency, as well as, PIs for whom informatics is a key part of their research. Curriculum: The curriculum will cover the roles and responsibilities of a lab leader in collaborative, mentor, or employer relationships with informatics experts. It will cover budgeting for cancer informatics locally or on the cloud. The course will also cover key responsibilities for lab leaders (including PIs and staff) in data security, privacy, management and reproducibility. This course will feature a range of ITCR tools from the very general (Galaxy7, Bioconductor56) to those that are very application specific (CRAVAT10, CIVIC13) but tools will only be featured at a conceptual level, rather than through hands on engagement in workflows. For more in-depth information about particular tools, see our other courses. 1.2 Informatics for Cancer Research Biomedical research at large, and in particular cancer research, has come to involve massive amounts of new data types collected through rapidly advancing technologies. To allow current and future cancer researchers to fully take advantage of the informatics opportunities afforded by these technologies, our mission is to make informatics tools as accessible as possible to all cancer researchers. From omics data, to imaging, to clinical data, cancer researchers can now examine biospecimens, animal models, and clinical data with unprecedented depth and breadth. This course aims to provide an overview of tools available to cancer researchers to afford them more flexibility in their research. "],

["about-the-authors.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors Carrie Wright is a Research Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Prior to joining the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab, Dr. Wright was a Posdoctoral Fellow at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development (LIBD), where her research focused on uncovering genetic mechanisms in psychiatric disease through the utilization of data science tools. At LIBD, Dr. Wright cofounded the LIBD rstats club, a community designed to encourage others to learn more about R programming and statistics. Dr. Wright has also served as an instructor for the Baltimore Underground Science Space and the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. "]
