This requires more flexibility in our ability to communicate with team members who may have a distinct background from ourselves or from each other. Furthermore, team members often have different research and career goals. This can present unique challenges in making sure that everyone is on the same page and cohesively working together. This course aims to provide research leaders with some guidance about how to effectively interact with and guide team members on informatics projects. 2.1 Collaborating with Informatics Experts Studies investigating the nature of biology research labs over history indicate that collaboration has been on the rise since the 1950s1 and that the rate continues to increase2. Indeed the size of biology research teams appear to have doubled from 1955 to 19901. But why? 2.1.1 What are the benefits of collaboration? Shared cost - Now that research often involves expensive technology, it is cost effective to share resources. Shared expertise - Now that technology affords answering in some cases more complex research questions or in some cases broader research questions, it is often more effective to employ multiple contributors with different knowledge, skills, and perspectives. Researchers have noted that their own concept of their field changed as a result of working with investigators from other disciplines. Thus this can lead to innovation 3. Shared burden - Doing part of the work for a project using the knowledge and skills that you are most comfortable with and seeking help from others who are more knowledgeable on other research aspects can be a more efficient strategy. Shared reliability - Including multiple team members who can each evaluate the research can improve the reliability of a project, as mistakes can be found by other members. Shared credibility - Collaborations involving experts of multiple areas can imporve the percieved credibility of the work by others. 2.1.2 Potential Challenges: Challenging communication - Extra care needs to be taken to ensure that communication across groups is effective. Typically researchers will not meet as often with a collaborator as they would with an internal team member. Therefore, poor communication in a collaboration can lead to more costly misdirection and thus wasted time and effort. Furthermore, as investigators often have different backgrounds, differences in jargon and language can make communication more challenging. Having internal team members with some familiarity with informatics can be very beneficial for translating discussions with collaborators who are informatics experts. One solution to this is to have students, post docs, and other trainees work in both labs. This can be especially beneficial time for the trainee who will become accustomed to two research styles allowing them to potentially have their own multi-disciplinary lab in the future3. Another important method that can help resolve this issue is to have members provide educational seminars for participating members about the fundamentals of their work. Differing research style and goals - Beyond differences in language, differences in research style and goals can lead to conflict. “Scholars’ different styles of thought, standards, research traditions, techniques, and languages can be difficult to translate across disciplinary domains.” 3 Making clear research standards and goals, as well as outlining clear specific tasks at the beginning of a project can help to avoid this issue. Furthermore, meeting consistently throughout the duration of a project can also help to make sure that standards are in agreement. Additionally these meetings should include discussions about intellectual property, authorship, leadership, and defining what sucess looks likes to the various members. Defining these details early can avoid major conflict later. Furthermore, it is critical to keep in mind the diversity of career goals of research team members, as junior team members may have a challenging time persuading others of their independence and contributions when they work on largely collaborative projects. It is also necessary to ensure that junior members have time to devote to their own research programs. 2 Support should be provided for these junior collaborators by more senior collaborators. Different contributions - Research of multi-disciplinary collaborations have found that when collaborating members were unclear of how their expertise and work contributed to the projected, they were less motivated and felt less valued. Working with members of different backgrounds to determine how their expertise can contribute to the project will not only help with moral, but it can also better define how a collaborator can further contribute to a project in ways that you may not already expect!3 Reduced sense of responsibility - Another concern of collaboration is that team members may feel less responsibility or commitment to a project than for a project within their own lab. Defining tasks and expected due dates can help reduce this issue. Discussions to establish due dates should always include team members with expertise in each area of science, as tasks may not take the amount of time that another researcher would expect. It is a common misconception that informatics tasks take less time than the the tasks actually take in reality. Research is dynamic - Research always has an element of trial and error. Protocols may change and new scientific questions may emerge. Frequent meetings with all group members to understand the dynamics of the project are critical. Furthermore, flexibility and understanding is required. It should be expected that aspects about the project will change. Differences in resources - Particularly when collaborating with community members, community colleges, and institutions that are “Equity-oriented” serving populations that have historically been referred to as “minorities”1(https://diverseeducation.com/article/91247/), it is important to keep in mind that large differences in resources may exist between collaborating members. Sharing and discussing budget information early and often can help research members to understand what expectations are reasonable and how collaboration partners may best assist one another. 2.1.3 There are multiple ways to approach collaboration. AVOCADO - this section needs to be more tailored. Four types have been defined by a study of scientific collaboration 5: Bureaucratic - Collaborations of this style have a high level of formality, hierarchy, guidelines, and rules with clear specialized divisions of labor and responsibilities. This is particularly a useful strategy if any collaboration members have been historically competitive with one another or there is a large amount of money involved. Legal contracts and external evaluations are common. Leaderless - There is administrative leadership but no scientific leadership. This allows for more flexibility scientifically. Non-specialized - There is no specialized division of labor despite hierarchical leadership. This method is especially useful for assessing reproducibility of a finding or for evaluating the reliability of a method. Teams are given the same tasks to work on. Participatory - This style is the least formal, yet still maintains aspects of leadership and division of labor. Researchers contribute equally to decisions about the project, there is no designated scientific leader. No legal or formal agreements are used, rather informal understandings are used as the foundation for guiding the project. Of note, the term Participatory action in contrast, involves collaborating with community members. Participatory action research values the knowledge,experiences, and norms of community members and seeks to incorporate these into research projects. Its goal is to create new knowledge thatleads to effective social action that solves real-life problems.2 2.2 Employing informatics experts In contrast to collaborating with informatics experts, in some case it may be beneficial to directly employ them on your team. There are again pros and and cons for this strategy. By directly employing an informatics expert, rather than collaborating with an expert, research leaders will have more access to meet with these experts, as well as more sway in terms of guiding the direction of the experts’ work. They can also potentially grow the informatics part of their research program more readily which would then lead to even more flexibility in the research questions that they may be able to assess. However, direct employment of informatics experts requires all of the typical responsibilities and costs of employing another lab member. It also requires the additional resource requirements for the informatics work of the particular expert. This will be discussed more in a later section of this course. In addition is is useful to become familiar with best practices for ethics, reliability, and reproducibility in computational work. This requires some different tactics than that of experiment based research (often called “wet lab” research). Although it is also useful for informatics expert to keep track of the work that they have performed in general, similar to maintaining notes about experimental research with a lab notebook, a much deeper level of detail can be tracked and maintained. What we mean by this, is that the actual code and data used in their work can be saved over time. This can be invaluable for research reproducbility. Thus research leaders are advised to become familiar with best practices for data sharing and data management so that they can most effectively manage their informatics employees. This is also discussed in more detail later in the course. 2.3 Mentoring informatics students 2.3.1 Career goals Career goals for informatics students can be very different than that of other research students. By having informatics expertise, these students have additional career opportunities. 2.3.2 Additional training 2.4 References Vermeulen, Niki, John N.
