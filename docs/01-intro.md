# Introduction 

## Motivation
This course will cover the key cancer informatics topics principal investigators and other research leaders need to know when running a lab. 

_Target Audiance:_ 
The course is intended for PIs and other lab leaders who want to learn how to transition their labs into using cancer informatics tools, for those who rely on cancer informatics but for whom it is not a core competency, as well as, PIs for whom informatics is a key part of their research. 

_Curriculum:_
The curriculum will cover the roles and responsibilities of a lab leader in collaborative, mentor, or employer relationships with informatics experts. It will cover budgeting for cancer informatics locally or on the cloud. The course will also cover key responsibilities for lab leaders (including PIs and staff) in data security, privacy, management and reproducibility.  

This course will feature a range of ITCR tools from the very general (Galaxy7, Bioconductor56) to those that are very application specific (CRAVAT10, CIVIC13) but tools will only be featured at a conceptual level, rather than through hands on engagement in workflows. For more in-depth information about particular tools, see our other courses at our website: www.itcrtraining.org. 

## Informatics for Cancer Research

Biomedical research at large, and in particular cancer research, now involves massive amounts of data  of a variety of types collected through rapidly advancing technologies. To allow current and future cancer researchers to fully take advantage of the opportunities afforded by these technologies, our mission is to make informatics tools as accessible as possible to all cancer researchers.  From omics data, to imaging, to clinical data, cancer researchers can now examine biospecimens, animal models, and clinical data with unprecedented depth and breadth.

This course aims to provide an overview of tools available to cancer researchers to afford them more flexibility in their research.
